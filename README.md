# M-6-1--Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation

# Online Retail Segmentation using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting online retail customers using **machine learning** techniques such as **K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering**. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, spending patterns, and purchase frequency to enhance marketing strategies and customer experience.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes transactional data with fields like **Customer ID, Invoice Date, Product Category, Purchase Amount, and Frequency**.
- Data is preprocessed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize features for better clustering.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Normalizing numerical features for accurate clustering.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing customer purchase patterns.
   - Identifying trends using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

3. **Clustering Algorithms**
   - **K-Means Clustering**: Used for customer segmentation based on spending habits.
   - **DBSCAN**: Identifies dense customer clusters and anomalies.
   - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Helps in understanding customer relationships.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Silhouette Score & Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - **Customer Segmentation Analysis** to interpret business insights.

## Results & Insights
- Identified different customer groups such as **high-value buyers, frequent shoppers, and one-time buyers**.
- Helped businesses in **personalized marketing campaigns and loyalty programs**.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering
- **Visualization**: Power BI / Tableau for interactive dashboards

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Load the dataset and run the script.
3. Visualize results using **Power BI/Tableau dashboards**.

## Conclusion
This project helps businesses improve customer engagement by identifying different purchasing behaviors, leading to **better targeting and optimized marketing strategies**.
